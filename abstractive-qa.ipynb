    "## Introduction\n",
    "Abstractive QA (Question Answering) is a type of natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves generating an answer to a given question in natural language by summarizing and synthesizing information from various sources, rather than just selecting an answer from pre-existing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike extractive QA, which relies on identifying and extracting relevant passages of text from a corpus of documents to answer a question, abstractive QA systems are capable of generating new, original sentences that capture the key information and meaning required to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how MyScale can assist you in creating a abstractive QA application with openai api. There are three primary components required to construct a question-answering system:\n",
    "1. A vector index for semantic search storage and execution.\n",
    "2. A retriever model to embed contextual passages.\n",
    "3. OpenAI API for answer extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [bitcoin_articles dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balabaskar/bitcoin-news-articles-text-corpora), which contains a collection of news articles on Bitcoin that have been obtained through web scraping from different sources on the Internet using the Newscatcher API. We'll use the retriever to create embeddings for the context passages, index them in the vector database, and execute a semantic search to retrieve the top k most relevant contexts with potential answers to our question. OpenAI API will then be used to generate answers based on the returned contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're more interested in exploring capabilities of MyScale, feel free to skip the [Building dataset](#building-dataset) section and dive right into the [Populating data to MyScale](#populate-data-to-myscale) section."
