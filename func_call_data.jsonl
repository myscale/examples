{"abstract":"  A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic\nrelationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with\nstatistical techniques, the graphical model has several advantages for data\nanalysis. One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it\nreadily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian\nnetwork can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to\ngain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of\nintervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and probabilistic\nsemantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which\noften comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in\nconjunction with Bayesian networks offer an efficient and principled approach\nfor avoiding the overfitting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for\nconstructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian\nstatistical methods for using data to improve these models.

In this paper, we provide\nthe first comprehensive study which assesses the robustness of CNN-based models\nfor computer networks against adversarial transferability.
